# The attempt to create a simple game 

During this challenge I tried to create a parallax effect in JavaScript and used eventListener to add controlling character's functionality.

Welcome to the world of my Totoro, who will move when you press **arrows** on the keyboard. 

He can walk to the left and to the right, he can fly but not over the top of screen. 

Pikachu will be a target to collect during the walk and Susuwatari are going to be obstacles. 

Still a lot to do, right? ) 

### ...I'am still working on it
